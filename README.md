# 🛡️ mitigate-tcp-floods

A virtualized Linux-based lab project to simulate, detect, and mitigate **TCP flooding attacks**. This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet effective DDoS protection setup using rate-limiting techniques, attack simulation tools, and real-time network monitoring in a controlled virtual environment.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project walks through:

- Virtualizing target (Ubuntu) and attacker (Kali) environments using VMware
- Simulating TCP flooding using tools like `hping3` and `ab`
- Detecting and mitigating attacks via custom Python scripts and optional `iptables` rules
- Monitoring traffic using Wireshark to observe attack patterns and protection response
